This can reduce their chances of being shortlisted, especially in competitive job markets.\n\n## 🤖 Solution\n\nWe developed a **Smart Job Application Assistant** that uses **Generative AI (Gemini 1.5 Pro & Flash)** to:\n- Extract structured data from resumes and job descriptions\n- Analyze and match skills and experiences\n- Generate highly personalized job application emails\n\nThis solution automates a tedious and critical part of job hunting, enhancing both efficiency and effectiveness.\n\n---","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 🧠 GenAI Capabilities Demonstrated\n\nThis project uses **three powerful capabilities of Generative AI**:\n\n1. **Structured Output / Controlled Generation**\n   - The model outputs structured JSON with fields like skills, experience, job title, and summary.\n\n2. **Document Understanding**\n   - Gemini analyzes resume and job descriptions from unstructured PDF/text and extracts relevant information.\n\n3. **Long Context Window**\n   - Gemini handles large documents with many tokens (e.g., long resumes and multi-paragraph job posts).\n\nThese capabilities were chosen as they directly solve real pain points in resume parsing and job matching.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Install required libraries for Google Generative AI and PDF processing","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install -q google-generativeai PyMuPDF","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-19T08:09:58.705707Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-19T08:09:58.705909Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-19T08:10:06.6017Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-19T08:09:58.705884Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-19T08:10:06.60065Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Set Up","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import os\nimport google.generativeai as genai\n\n# Retrieve and configure Google Generative AI with the secret API key\nfrom kaggle_secrets import UserSecretsClient\nGOOGLE_API_KEY = UserSecretsClient().get_secret(\"GOOGLE_API_KEY\")\n\ngenai.configure(api_key=GOOGLE_API_KEY)\n\nflash_model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-flash')\npro_model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-pro')\n","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-19T08:10:10.306994Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-19T08:10:10.307685Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-19T08:10:13.124918Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-19T08:10:10.30765Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-19T08:10:13.123976Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 📄Extract Text from Resume (PDF)\n\nWe start by extracting the raw text from a resume PDF file using PyMuPDF.\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-18T10:59:29.754351Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-18T10:59:29.755033Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-18T10:59:29.763862Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-18T10:59:29.755003Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-18T10:59:29.762844Z"}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import fitz  # PyMuPDF\nimport tempfile\nimport shutil\nimport traceback\n\ndef extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_file):\n    temp_file = None\n    try:\n        if isinstance(pdf_file, str):\n            file_path = pdf_file\n        else:\n            temp_file = tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False, suffix='.pdf')\n            temp_file.close()\n            with open(temp_file.name, 'wb') as f:\n                f.write(pdf_file.read())\n            file_path = temp_file.name\n\n        doc = fitz.open(file_path)\n        text = \"\"\n        for page_num in range(len(doc)):\n            text += doc.load_page(page_num).get_text()\n        return text.strip()\n    except Exception as e:\n        traceback.print_exc()\n        return f\"Error extracting text from PDF: {str(e)}\"\n    finally:\n        if 'doc' in locals():\n            doc.close()\n        if temp_file and os.path.exists(temp_file.name):\n            os.unlink(temp_file.name)\n","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-19T08:10:18.811983Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-19T08:10:18.812471Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-19T08:10:19.012389Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-19T08:10:18.812442Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-19T08:10:19.011388Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Load a sample PDF (upload your own on Kaggle)\nAdd data → Upload → New Dataset → Select file → Use (/kaggle/input/your-folder-name/your-file.pdf)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-19T05:58:27.826293Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-19T05:58:27.826655Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-19T05:58:27.834604Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-19T05:58:27.826623Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-19T05:58:27.833143Z"}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Load a sample PDF (upload your own on Kaggle)\nresume_path = \"/kaggle/input/resume/my_resume (2).pdf\"  # adjust path\nresume_text = extract_text_from_pdf(resume_path)\nprint(resume_text[:1000])  # Show first few characters\n","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-19T08:10:29.54282Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-19T08:10:29.543139Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-19T08:10:29.570055Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-19T08:10:29.543112Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-19T08:10:29.569048Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Enter a sample job description","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"job_desc_text = \"\"\"\nWe are seeking talented and motivated Full Stack Developer fresher to join our innovative software team.
